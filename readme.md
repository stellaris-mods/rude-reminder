Steam description transliterated from `steam.bbcode` by [our release script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stellaris-mods/scripts/master/stlrel).

## **Reminds you to get strategic resources from Trader Enclaves and the Festival from the Artists when you meet their criteria**

This addon works exactly like my other addon, [Curator\-Insight Curator](http://steamcommunity\.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=796214744), except it handles the strategic resources and the artist festival instead\.
